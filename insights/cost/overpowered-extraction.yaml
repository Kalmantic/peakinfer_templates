description: |
  Detects when expensive frontier models (GPT-4o, Claude Opus) are used
  for tasks with small outputs, typically extraction or classification.
  These tasks often perform equally well with cheaper models.

  evidence: "{{location}}: Consider gpt-4o-mini or claude-3-haiku for simple extraction tasks. Potential 10-20x cost reduction."

recommends:
  - optimization: smart-model-routing
    relevance: 0.95
    reason: "Route extraction tasks to cost-effective models like GPT-4o-mini"
